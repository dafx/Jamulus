Jamulus - Internet Jam Session Software
---------------------------------------

Low-Latency (Internet) Connection tool
Under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
http://llcon.sourceforge.net


INTRODUCTION:
The Jamulus software enables musicians to perform real-time jam sessions over
the internet. There is one server running the Jamulus server software which
collects the audio data from each Jamulus client software, mixes the audio data
and sends the mix back to each client.

The minimum internet connection speed at each client must be 128 kbps for up-
and downstream. To get satisfactory results, the ping time from the client
computer to the server should not exceed 40 ms average.

Jamulus runs under Windows (ASIO), MacOS (Core Audio) and Linux (Jack). The Jamulus
software package includes both, the client and the server functionality which
can be selected by using command line arguments.

For starting the server type ./Jamulus -s

The audio is compressed with the OPUS audio codec to ensure a low delay and a
low upload/download rate.
